                    <p class="project-info-text">To evaluate the effectiveness of our prototype, we conducted user
                        testing
                        sessions. During these sessions, users were shown our wireframes while we explained the
                        functionality of different screens. After our presentation, the users were given the opportunity
                        to
                        examine the wireframes more closely by zooming in for a detailed view.
                        <br><br>
                        <b> Feedback received:</b><br>
                        Overall, the feedback was positive, with users appreciating the product concept and wireframe
                        designs. However, one user pointed out the absence of a confirmation modal when clicking the
                        "Reorder" button, which could help prevent multiple unintended reorders. Another user suggested
                        that
                        the Integration page include recommended "ideal" integrations to enhance usability.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Observations and refinements:</b><br>
                        During the testing process, we noticed a few design elements that were missing or could be
                        improved.
                        For example, some charts and images were not labelled, and the Integration page lacked a "Delete
                        integration" button. Additionally, we realized that the "Reorder" functionality could be
                        optimized.
                        Initially, the design required users to manually review and reorder items, but we decided that
                        making the "Reorder" option a clickable button would be more efficient. With the AI feature
                        tracking
                        stock levels, users would simply click the button to reorder all low-stock items. To ensure
                        accuracy, a confirmation modal would appear after the button is clicked, allowing users to
                        confirm
                        the reorder before proceeding.

                    <p class="project-info-text">One of the strong points of this project was the research and the
                        initial wireframe designs. We were able to spot key pain points for our target users early on,
                        especially around inventory management and keeping track of stock levels in real-time. The
                        feedback we got from testing was super valuable, and we made adjustments that made the final
                        design more user-friendly.</p><br>

                    <ol class="list">
                        <li class="list-text"> <b>More customization:</b> If I could go back, I’d focus on giving users
                            even more options to customize things. For example, allowing them to drag, drop, hide, add,
                            or remove widgets on the Dashboard would give them more control over how they use the
                            product. I’d also want to let them create custom reports based on whichever metrics matter
                            most to them so they can get greater insight into their business.

                        </li>
                        <li class="list-text"> <b>Role-based permissions:</b> Another thing I’d change is adding more
                            flexibility around roles and permissions. Businesses should be able to assign roles and
                            decide who gets access to certain features or data. This would help teams work more smoothly
                            and protect sensitive info while letting everyone do their job effectively.

                        </li>
                        <li class="list-text"> <b>Updating the UI:</b> Visually, I’d want to modernize the UI a bit. Adding
                                a more polished and contemporary look would help the product feel more professional and
                                user-friendly. Little things like improving the typography, using a more cohesive colour
                                palette, and ensuring the icons are consistent could make a big difference in how the
                                product is perceived and used.

                    <p class="project-info-text">Overall, I think these changes would improve the product by giving
                        users more control, streamlining workflows, and making the interface more appealing.
